# LDJAM43 (Sacrifices must be made)

## Ideas

* Religion-sim. You have skills with cooldowns to scare or aid a vilage. You level up by them becoming more fanatic and the end goal is to make them sacrifice a first born. (You can possess non-humans)
* Climate change game, try to balance your life and figure out what you need to give up to lessen your footprint.
* The religous sime above, but you do it for the climate change reason.
* Matching game, direct the right offering to the right altars/gods. Incorrect sacrifices or no sacrifices for a set time lead to bad consequences.
* Journey game, group of travellers with different (random set?) of skills and equipment encounter different obstacles along the way, player needs to make choice of what/who to risk.
* Working life career game, start as new employee, to advance you have to sacrifice more and more of health, personality, values, social life/family etc. 
* Sacrifice parts of your body
* Sacrifice a skill at a time and still manage to make it to the goal.
* God trying to make your people stop sacrificing things and people but they really want to do it!
* Cooking game. Make cool deamons or something by combining the right recipes.
* Trolley problem-game
