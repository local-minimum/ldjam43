# LDJAM43 (Sacrifices must be made)

## Ideas

* Religion-sim. You have skills with cooldowns to scare or aid a vilage. You level up by them becoming more fanatic and the end goal is to make them sacrifice a first born. (You can possess non-humans)
* Climate change game, try to balance your life and figure out what you need to give up to lessen your footprint.
* The religous sime above, but you do it for the climate change reason.
* Matching game, direct the right offering to the right altars/gods. Incorrect sacrifices or no sacrifices for a set time lead to bad consequences.
* Journey game, group of travellers with different (random set?) of skills and equipment encounter different obstacles along the way, player needs to make choice of what/who to risk.
* Working life career game, start as new employee, to advance you have to sacrifice more and more of health, personality, values, social life/family etc. 
* Sacrifice parts of your body
* Sacrifice a skill at a time and still manage to make it to the goal.
* God trying to make your people stop sacrificing things and people but they really want to do it!
* Cooking game. Make cool deamons or something by combining the right recipes.
* Trolley problem-game
* At the altar you have options of what you can give up (color vision, get bad sight, jumping, going backwards, your soul(faster loss of life)). But you need to make sacrifices to replentish your life-force.
* Temple/religion career game, make more and more sacrifices (your own or others) to progress. Unclear if progressing is actually good for you.
* Procedural branching options game trying to guide people/group as a deity, where they constantly make poor decisions and blame you or try to sacrifice important things to you.
* Reverse climate change game. Trend in game society is for more sustainable society, player needs to actively counter this trend to protect consumption-based economy! (sacrificing future generations, bio diversity etc in the process).
