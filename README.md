# LDJAM43 (Sacrifices must be made)

## ToDo

* End of Play 1 (A scene. Two trains going head on. Time slows down. Crash. Some text like "Really? You had one job. One job!")
* End of Play 2 (A scene. Financial ruins? Being fired? Text: "The trains must keep running. Some sacrifices are necessary.")
* End of Play 3 (A scene. Train runs left to right. Mob of players chase it)
* UI for the currencies (Kills)
* People spawner
* I think people need to be predictable for this to be fun (else you have no chance avoiding them at all).
* Menu

## Wishes
* Highscore
* Audio

## Issues

* Mouse over should only check rail interactions not be affected by trains and people etc.
