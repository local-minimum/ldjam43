# LDJAM43 (Sacrifices must be made)

## ToDo

* Trainstation -> Bubble that shows gain!
* People Deaths -> Event (Negative Goodwill, Add NEWS).
* End of Play 1 (When trains collide)
* End of Play 2 (Financial ruins)
* End of Play 3 (Revolution, People Hate you)
* UI for the currencies (Kills)
* Highscore
* People spawner
* I think people need to be predictable for this to be fun (else you have no chance avoiding them at all).

## Issues

* Mouse over should only check rail interactions not be affected by trains and people etc.
