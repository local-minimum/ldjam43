# LDJAM43 (Sacrifices must be made)

## Ideas

* Religion-sim. You have skills with cooldowns to scare or aid a vilage. You level up by them becoming more fanatic and the end goal is to make them sacrifice a first born. (You can possess non-humans)
* Climate change game, try to balance your life and figure out what you need to give up to lessen your footprint.
* The religous sime above, but you do it for the climate change reason.
